# Codegen

An experiment on AOT and JIT code generation, including IR transformations for
optimisation.

The goal of this project is not only to learn how to implement optimisations by
putting into practice data-flow analysis theory, but also to design and
structure the code as clearly as possible such that it is easy for others to
read, and thus learn from. This project currently focusses on the back-end, so
front-end operations such as lexing and parsing are omitted.

The project will take an incremental approach of first compiling a tiny subset
of the source language all the way down to the target language or machine code,
which at the moment is x64, then gradually increasing the size of the
subset&mdash;a method inspired by 
Abdulaziz Ghuloum's [_An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction_](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.170&rep=rep1&type=pdf),
and Nora Sandler's [_Writing a C Compiler_](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html).

# Current Progress

The program is currently capable of transforming, _without optimisations_, an
AST representing a C-like compound statement containing multiple return
statements with optional unsigned 32-bit integer return values, to x64 assembly,
then executing it dynamically. An example is as follows:

Input AST:

```
compound_statement
|-return_statement
| `-integer_literal 3735928559U # 0xDEADBEEF
|-return_statement
`-return_statement
  `-integer_literal 0U
```

IR:

```
0000 basic_block {
    return uint32 3735928559U
    return void
    return uint32 0U
}
```

Generated bytes:

```
            00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
0x00000000: B8 EF BE AD DE C3 C3 B8 00 00 00 00 C3           .............
```

Disassembly:

```asm
0x00000000: mov     eax, 0xDEADBEEF
0x00000005: ret
0x00000006: ret
0x00000007: mov     eax, 0
0x0000000C: ret
```

Execution:

```
function() = 0xDEADBEEF
```

# Building

| Requirement                             | Minimum Version |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| [CMake](https://cmake.org/)             | 3.23            |
| [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)       | -               |
| [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) | -               |
| C++ Compiler                            | C++23 support   |

CMake and Ninja are available through your system package manager.

Although not advised, libraries that are used can be found in
[vcpkg.json](/vcpkg.json), and can alternatively be installed manually using
your system package manager as well.

Build using the following commands:

```
cmake --preset <preset> .
cmake --build ./build/<preset>
```

Where `<preset>` is one of the non-hidden presets in
[CMakePresets.json](/CMakePresets.json). The `/build` directory will contain the
executable.
